= Three pitfalls in I<sup>2</sup>C
:tags: i2c, smbus, pedantry

I recently implemented an I^2^C slave, and came across a few interesting corner
cases in the specification.

== I^2^C basics

I^2^C is a multi-master, low-speed, bidirectional bus specified in
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-guide/UM10204.pdf[NXP UM10204]. There are only
two signals: SCL (the clock) and SDA (the data). Each of the signals is
open-drain, with resistors pulling the signals high. This property is used
throughout the protocol. For example, by defining an acknowledgement (ack) as
holding SDA low, there is an implicit negative acknowledgement (nack) when no
device responds to a transaction.

The general format of transactions is

* a start condition
* a 7-bit address
* a read/[.overline]#write# bit
* an acknowledgement
* any number of number of data bytes, each followed by an acknowledgement
* a stop condition

For example, in the following diagram shows a single-byte read:

++++
<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [
  { name: "SCL", wave: "1.01|01010101|010101." },
  { name: "SDA", wave: "10=.|=.1.0.=.|=.1.0.1" },
],
  foot: {
    tock: '​ start ​ addr[6] … ​ addr[0] ​ R/W ​ ack ​ data[7] … ​ data[0] ​ nack ​ ​ stop '
  }
}
</script>
++++

SDA is valid on the rising edge of SCL, and SDA changes on the falling edge of
SCL. To signal the start and end of the transaction, SDA transitions with SCL
high. This framing violation makes it easy to re-synchronize the master/slave
state machines.

An important aspect of I^2^C that is not visible in the above diagram is who is
sending data. Because the signals are open-drain, both the master and slave can
drive the bus at the same time. The following diagram shows what the internal
drivers of SDA in the above transaction might look like:

++++
<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [
  { name: "SCL",          wave: "1.01|01010101|010101." },
  { name: "SDA (actual)", wave: "10=.|=.1.0.=.|=.1.0.1" },
  { name: "SDA (master)", wave: "10=.|=.1.....|....0.1" },
  { name: "SDA (slave)",  wave: "1...|....0.=.|=.1...." },
],
  foot: {
    tock: '​ start ​ addr[6] … ​ addr[0] ​ R/W ​ ack ​ data[7] … ​ data[0] ​ nack ​ ​ stop '
  }
}
</script>
++++

At the beginning of the transaction the master sends data on the bus, while
the slave leaves its SDA high. Then the slave acknowledges the request and
sends a byte of data. Since this is the last byte the master wants to read, the
master doesn't acknowledge the data and sends a stop condition.

== Quick reads

One of the shortest types of I^2^C transactions is the quick read/write (so
named by http://www.smbus.org/[SMBus]). These transfer one bit of data in the
read/[.overline]#write# bit following the address. Once the master receives an
ack, it sends the stop condition to end the transaction. In addition to
transfering a bit of data, these transactions can also be used as a heuristic
way of detecting available slaves (such as with
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/i2c-tools/i2c-tools.git/about/[i2cdetect]).
The following diagram shows a successful quick read:

++++
<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [
  { name: "SCL", wave: "1.01|010101." },
  { name: "SDA", wave: "10=.|=.1.0.1" },
],
  foot: {
    tock: '​ start ​ addr[6] … ​ addr[0] ​ R/W ​ ack stop '
  }
}
</script>
++++

From the slave's point of view, a quick read looks just like a regular read
transaction. This can prevent the master from sending the stop condition if the
first bit of the byte is a 0, since the slave will hold SDA low. If the read
byte is all 0s, the slave won't release SDA until the ack bit:

++++
<script type="WaveDrom">
{ signal: [
  { name: "SCL", wave: "1.01|01010101|010101." },
  { name: "SDA", wave: "10=.|=.1.0...|..1.0.1" },
],
  foot: {
    tock: '​ start ​ addr[6] … ​ addr[0] ​ R/W ​ ack ​ data[7] … ​ data[0] ​ nack ​ ​ stop '
  }
}
</script>
++++

When designing a slave, this can be avoided by ensuring that the first bit of
any read transaction is 1. If the slave has a "`command`" or sub-address
register which needs to be written as the first byte of a transaction, the
default data before the command register is written can be all 1s for the same
effect.

From the master's perspective, all that is needed is to continue reading out
the byte until there is a high bit. This is guaranteed to happen when the slave
waits for an ack.

== SDA hold time ambiguity

While using coding violations for framing is a common technique, it creates a
conflict on the falling edge of SCL. If a slave sees SDA fall before SCL, it
can detect a spurious start/stop condition.

image::{static}images/i2c_timing_upper.png[]

SMBus versions before 3.0 specified a 300 ns minimum hold time (t~HD;DAT~).
This ensures that other devices on the bus see SCL transition before SDA.

I^2^C, on the other hand, has a minimum hold time of 0 seconds. Versions 6 and
earlier of UM10204 suggested the following solution:

> A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA
> signal (with respect to the V~IH(min)~ of the SCL signal) to bridge the
> undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.

That is, if a device detects a start/stop condition it must wait 300 ns before
doing anything. If SCL is still high, it was a real start/stop. Otherwise it
was just a data transition. The 300 ns value in both I^2^C and SMBus is
t~f~, or the maximum fall time. Waiting this long ensures that SCL has
transitioned before we sample SDA.

To allow for greater compatibility between SMBus and I^2^C devices, SMBus
versions 3.0 and later reduce t~HD;DAT~ to 0 seconds. In a lengthy appendix,
they suggest using the same strategy as I^2^C.

Despite this, version 7 of UM10204 seems to suggest that neither a 300 ns hold
time nor an internal delay are necessary to resolve this issue. Looking closely
at the timing diagram, t~HD;DAT~ is defined as the time between when SCL falls
to 30% V~DD~ (logical 0), and when SDA rises above 30% V~DD~ or falls below 70%
V~DD~. Therefore, it suggests that devices 

> Ensure SCL drops below 0.3 V~DD~ on falling edge before SDA crosses into the
> indeterminate range of 0.3 V~DD~ to 0.7 V~DD~.

Regarding masters which don't support clock stretching and don't have inputs on
SCL, UM10204 continues:

> For controllers that cannot observe the SCL falling edge then independent
> measurement of the time for the SCL transition from static high (V~DD~) to
> 0.3 V~DD~ should be used to insert a delay of the SDA transition with respect
> to SCL

effectively mandating a 300 ns hold time... which is what SMBus switched away
from.

However, even masters supporting clock stretching should still use a delay for
two reasons: First, it is difficult to detect when SCL falls below 30% V~DD~,
since in typical implementations the entire region from 30–70% V~DD~ is
indeterminate. And second, devices with series protection resistors might not
see the same value on SDA as the transmitter, since there will be a voltage
difference across the resistor.

For maximum compatibility, devices should implement both an output hold time
and an internal hold time when detecting start/stop conditions.

=== Implementation support

Unfortunately, despite much vacillation in SMBus and I^2^C, this issue does not
seem to be known to some implementors. A quick survey of open-source
implementations reveals fairly patchy handling:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=I%C2%B2C&oldid=1153206437#Example_of_bit-banging_the_I2C_protocol[Wikipedia's
  bitbang implementation], doesn't wait between `clear_SCL` and `set_SDA` in
  `i2c_write_bit`. That said, it doesn't seem to support multi-master busses,
  so it may be assuming slaves with an internal hold time.
* https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/i2c/algos/i2c-algo-bit.c?id=6995e2de6891c724bfeb2db33d7b87775f913ad1[Linux]
  doesn't wait between `scllo` and `setsda` in `i2c_outb`, but it doesn't seem
  to support multi-master busses either. Some of the hardware-accelerated
  drivers seem to be aware of this issue, and support configurable hold times.
  This allows using the SMBus pre-3.0 solution, as long as all slaves also
  support it.
* Neither the master nor slaves in
  https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-i2c/tree/4a41d477568646617776681cea53ba8a6391c14f[Alex
  Forencich's I^2^C project] seem to delay for a hold time or use an internal hold time.
* https://github.com/freecores/i2c/tree/3b067f00ccced753b0502024766a51f58f3e04bc[Freecores`'
  master] doesn't add an internal hold time or use an internal hold time.

It's often unclear whether commercial implementations correctly handle this
ambiguity. For example, this
https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/doc0336.pdf[AT24 EEPROM
datasheet] specifies a 0 second hold time, but doesn't mention any internal
hold time. Many vendors support
https://microchip.my.site.com/s/article/SERCOM-I2C-SDA-hold-time-for-SAM-D-series[configurable
hold times], which shows they are aware of the issue. Occasionally, there are
https://ams.com/documents/20143/36005/TMD2772_AN000257_1-00.pdf/b7b5fe57-00f0-115b-f855-3a75378ccb0e[errata
regarding it].

I suspect that for most hardware this ambiguity becomes an issue when the input
threshold voltage is on the low end. This could cause a rising SDA to be
detected before a falling SCL. This is exacerbated by high bus capacitance,
but many busses have low (a few dozen pF) capacitance. As with many timing
violations, mean time between failure can be quite long, and incorrect
implementations may not be noticed.

== Fast-mode Plus compatibility

The original (Standard-mode) I^2^C runs at 100 KHz, but UM10204 also includes a
backwards-compatible "`Fast-mode`" which runs at 400 KHz. There are also
"`High-speed mode`" and "`Ultra Fast-mode`" varients which are not backwards
compatible. In 2007, NXP introduced a "`Fast-mode Plus`" which runs at 1 Mhz
and was designed to be backwards-compatible. SMBus also incorporated this mode
into version 3.0.

To determine what a Fast-mode Plus slave needs to do to be backwards
compatible, let's first examine Fast-mode backwards-compatibility. For a
Fast-mode slave to be backwards compatible with Standard-mode, its input and
output timings must be compatible with both Standard-mode and Fast-mode.
Generally, output timings are the same as Fast-mode. Standard-mode only
requires a longer setup time, which will be met as long as the slave doesn't
stretch the clock. Similarly, input timings are mostly the same as Fast-mode.
One issue could be the internal hold time necessary for the SDA ambiguity
detailed above. However, both Standard- and Fast-mode specify a 300 ns fall
time (t~f~), which is less than Fast-mode's 600 ns start condition setup time
(t~SU;STA~). Therefore, the same 300 ns hold time can be used for both modes.

image::{static}images/i2c_timing_lower.png[]

Unfortunately, Fast-mode Plus reduced t~SU;STA~ to 260 ns in order to achieve
a higher clock rate. This means that every Fast-mode Plus start condition is
within the SDA hold time ambiguity in Fast- and Standard-mode. A slave which
implements the 300 ns internal delay required by Fast- and Standard-mode will
not be able to detect Fast-mode Plus start conditions with minimum-specified
delay.

There are some ways to mitigate this at the system level:

* All bust masters could be configured to run at 960 kHz, which (if t~SU;STA~
  is scaled as well) will provide enough of a delay to ensure start times will
  be detected correctly.
* Components with higher slew rates could be selected to ensure t~f~ remains
  below 260 ns. Alternatively, bus line capacitance could be reduced below the
  maximum.

As well as some ways to mitigate this at the device level:

* A configuration bit (such as a register or a pin) could configure the device
  to be either Fast-mode or Fast-mode Plus compatible. This could even be
  automatically detected, although this would need to be done carefully since
  masters can switch speed at any time. For example, a master might run at one
  speed when accessing a certain device, and another speed when accessing a
  different device.
* The input drivers could be engineered to have a lower V~IH~ and a higher
  V~IL~, reducing the time of ambiguity (assuming monotonic transitions).

But, as-written, the Fast-mode Plus timings are incompatible with Fast- and
Standard-mode. Pre-3.0 SMBus and post-v7 I^2^C are not affected because they do
not require an internal hold time.
